# 🚀 Setting Up nanoNAS on GitHub

This guide will help you publish your nanoNAS project to GitHub with all the professional features and workflows.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Git installed on your system
- GitHub account
- SSH or HTTPS authentication set up with GitHub

## 🎯 Quick Setup (Automated)

### Option 1: Use the Setup Script

```bash
# Make the script executable (if not already)
chmod +x scripts/setup_github.sh

# Run with your repository URL
./scripts/setup_github.sh https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nanonas.git
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

Follow the detailed steps below if you prefer manual control.

## 🔧 Manual GitHub Setup

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `nanonas` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `Neural Architecture Search framework with multiple search strategies`
   - **Public/Private**: Choose based on your preference
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we have these already)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Initialize Local Git Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "/home/ratnesh/Downloads/Projects/Karpathy level project"

# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Set up proper branch naming
git branch -M main
```

### Step 3: Add and Commit Files

```bash
# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: initial nanoNAS framework implementation

- Complete neural architecture search framework
- Multiple search strategies (Evolutionary, DARTS, Random)
- Comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation
- Advanced visualization capabilities
- Docker support and CI/CD pipeline
- Graduate-school level documentation

This represents a complete transformation from basic AutoML-CodeGen
to a publication-ready Neural Architecture Search framework."
```

### Step 4: Add Remote Repository

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Or if using SSH:
# git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
```

### Step 5: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push main branch to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Create and push develop branch
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop
git checkout main
```

## 🔧 GitHub Configuration

### Step 6: Enable GitHub Features

1. **Enable Discussions** (optional):
   - Go to repository Settings
   - Scroll down to "Features"
   - Check "Discussions"

2. **Set up Branch Protection**:
   - Go to Settings → Branches
   - Add rule for `main` branch
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass

3. **Configure GitHub Pages** (for documentation):
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: `main` / `docs`

### Step 7: Add Repository Secrets

For the CI/CD pipeline to work fully, add these secrets in Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

```
CODECOV_TOKEN      # For code coverage reporting (optional)
DOCKER_USERNAME    # For Docker Hub publishing (optional)
DOCKER_TOKEN       # For Docker Hub publishing (optional)
PYPI_API_TOKEN     # For PyPI publishing (optional)
```

## 📈 Repository Management

### Branch Strategy

- **`main`**: Production-ready code, protected branch
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for new features
- **`feature/*`**: Feature development branches
- **`bugfix/*`**: Bug fix branches
- **`hotfix/*`**: Critical fixes for main

### Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Make changes and add tests
3. Push branch and create pull request
4. Code review and CI checks
5. Merge to `develop`
6. Periodic merges from `develop` to `main`

### Release Process

1. Create release branch from `develop`
2. Update version numbers and changelog
3. Merge to `main` and tag release
4. GitHub Actions automatically publishes to PyPI
5. Docker images built and published

## 🔧 Local Development Setup

After cloning from GitHub:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nanonas.git
cd nanonas

# Set up development environment
make install-dev

# Run tests to verify setup
make test

# Run a quick experiment
make search
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Analytics

### GitHub Insights

Monitor your repository health:
- **Pulse**: Activity overview
- **Contributors**: Contribution statistics
- **Traffic**: Views and clones
- **Dependency graph**: Security and dependencies

### CI/CD Monitoring

Watch the Actions tab for:
- Build status and history
- Test results and coverage
- Performance trends
- Security scans
