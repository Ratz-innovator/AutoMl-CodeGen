"""
Neural Network Models and Components for nanoNAS
==============================================

This module contains neural network operations, model builders,
and specialized components for different search strategies.

Components:
- Operations: Basic building blocks (conv, pool, etc.)
- Networks: Model builders for architectures
- Supernet: DARTS supernet implementation
