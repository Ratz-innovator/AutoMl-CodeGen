## üî¨ Development Journey & Problem Solving

### Challenge 1: From Broken to Working
**Initial State**: Found a non-functional NAS implementation using fake random data
```python
# Broken: Fake evaluation
x = torch.randn(32, 3, 32, 32)  # Random data
acc = random.uniform(0.1, 0.2)  # Fake accuracy
```

**Solution**: Built real CIFAR-10 training pipeline
```python
# Fixed: Real evaluation  
dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(train=True, download=True)
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for data, target in dataloader:
        # Actual training with SGD optimizer
```

### Challenge 2: Scaling from Toy to Research-Grade
**Problem**: Models were tiny (10K parameters) with poor performance
**Solution**: Enhanced architecture design
- Increased channels from 16 to 128
